# Covid-19-detecting-neural-network

This project utilised tensorflow to try and create a convolutional Neural Network that attempts to detect if a patient has covid-19 or pneumonia based on an x-tray scan of their chest. This project uses categorical accuracy, early stopping and stochastic gradient decent to achieve an average success rate of 82%.
